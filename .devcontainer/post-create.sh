#
# Deliberately short. postCreateCommand runs from scratch on every rebuild and
# VS Code holds the container "not ready" until it returns, so this file does
# only the things that are both fast and required before anything else works --
# fixing up the ownership of the named-volume mounts. Everything slow was split
# two ways:
#
#   - system packages (texlive, Playwright's shared libraries) moved into
#     .devcontainer/Dockerfile, where Docker caches them as image layers and a
#     rebuild skips them entirely
#   - the browser download and the bnb-ext dev build moved into
#     .devcontainer/deferred-setup.sh, launched detached at the bottom of this
#     file so they finish in the background while the workspace is already
#     usable
#
# Idempotent -- re-run it by hand from an integrated terminal if setup looks
# incomplete:
#   bash .devcontainer/post-create.sh

Container ready. The e2e browser download and the bnb-ext dev build are still
running in the background; follow them with

    tail -f $DEFERRED_LOG

They aren't needed for editing, \`pnpm test\`, \`pnpm build\`, or bnb-cli.
